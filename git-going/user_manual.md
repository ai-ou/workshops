# git-going

This workshop is divided into four main phases:

1. Dual booting
2. Setting up Python supporting software
3. Intro to Python
4. Intro to NumPy

You will also use basic functionality of `git`. Git is a powerful and widely used tool for 'version control' of code, which allows for effective collaboration between multiple people working on a project.

To get started, 'clone' this repository onto your machine:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ai-ou/workshops.git
```

You will now have a copy of the repository code in a folder named 'workshops'. Change folders to `workshops/git-going` to reach the code for this workshop.

`python_intro.py` contains a brief tutorial on Python.

`numpy_intro.py` contains a brief tutorial on NumPy.
